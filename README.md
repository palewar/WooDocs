# How to improve Woocommerce Documentation for Developers

Issues with state of Developer Documentaion right now:

1. **Can't Contribute**
2. **Structure**
3. **Gaps**
4. **Outdated**


**Can't Contribute**

Developer Documentation should be moved to a 'Docs' folder inside the https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce and it should be just simple 'Markdown' files. So anyone can make changes and sent a PR. It will make it easier for normal folks to send small, simple PRs for things, like fixing a typo, updaring outdated URLs and also in general to contribute to docs. Right now Docs is a mish-mash of Wordpress pages, auto-generated docs (PHP Docs, Storybook) and Github Wiki. Lots of very useful documentation is still in Github Wiki and isn't linked anywhere on the Woocommerce Website. People can't send PRs for Wiki, so basically people can't contribute to docs at all right now. It's time to have a separate Docs team (A separate Docs channel on Slack even!).

**Structure**

It's not easy to find, navigate docs currently. If you are browing Github repo, it takes you, Developer Docs will take you to the WiKi, but on https://developer.woocommerce.com/#reference-docs WiKi is no where linked directly.
